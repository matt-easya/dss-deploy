# Interchain Token Service

## Introduction

This repo provides an implementation for an Interchain Token Service and an Interchain Token using it. The interchain token service is meant to allow users/developers to easily create their own token bridge. All the underlying interchain communication is done by the service, and the deployer can either use an `InterchainToken` that the service provides, or their own implementations. There are quite a few different possible configurations for bridges, and any user of any deployed bridge needs to trust the deployer of said bridge, much like any user of a token needs to trust the operator of said token. We plan to eventually remove upgradability from the service to make this protocol more trustworthy. Please reference the [design description](./DESIGN.md) for more details on the design.
